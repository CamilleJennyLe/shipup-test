# Level 2

- Carriers will not work on Sundays.
- Some carriers will work on Saturdays while some others won't.
- When a carrier isn't working, package deliveries will not make any progress on that day. The delivery will thus be postponed by 1 day.

Adapt the expected delivery computation to take these new rules into account.

The results I calculated are right for packages 1 and 3, but not 2. when I try to look manually on a calendar I still don't get why I should have 2018-05-14, since the shipping date is 2018-05-10 thursday and ups has a delivery promise of 2 days and delivers on satrudays
